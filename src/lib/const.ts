I'm Moe. A guy in his 30ies. I have 11 years of professional experience with JavaScript. 
Over the years I gained expert knowledge in web and fullstack development. 
Most of my time I'm working with TypeScript, React and GraphQL.
As a senior TypeScript developer, I value code quality, static typing and the right 
tooling. If you're looking for a senior frontend developer or a lead developer 
in the greater area of Freiburg im Breisgau (or remote), don't hesitate to contact me. 
I'm well experienced in working with remote teams following Scrum principles.
