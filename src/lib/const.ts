Hi, I'm Moritz (Moe). A passionate web developer in his 30ies. 
I have 12+ years of professional experience with JavaScript. 
Over the years I gained expert knowledge in web and fullstack development. 
Most of my time I'm working with TypeScript, React and GraphQL.
As a senior TypeScript developer, I value code quality, static typing and the right 
tooling. I am used to Scrum and experienced in realizing sophisticated projects for big clients. 
If you're looking for a senior frontend developer or a lead developer in the 
greater area of Freiburg im Breisgau (or remote), don't hesitate to contact me.
